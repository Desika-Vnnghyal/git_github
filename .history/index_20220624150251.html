<h2>What is Git?</h2>
Git is a version control system which lets you track changes you make to your files over time. With Git, you can revert to various states of your files (like a time traveling machine). You can also make a copy of your file, make changes to that copy, and then merge these changes to the original copy.

For example, you could be working on a website's landing page and discover that you do not like the navigation bar. But at the same time, you might not want to start altering its components because it might get worse.

With Git, you can create an identical copy of that file and play around with the navigation bar. Then, when you are satisfied with your changes, you can merge the copy to the original file.

You are not limited to using Git just for source code files – you can also use it to keep track of text files or even images. This means that Git is not just for developers – anyone can find it helpful.
